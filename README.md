Data Science Portfolio
----------------------

Thank you for interest in my data science portfolio. Repository
containing portfolio of data science projects completed by me for self
learning and/or academic purposes. This collection isnâ€™t a exhausitve
list of projects more like means to showcase certain skills I can use
reliably - presented in the form of R (and markdown), Python, Matlab and
SQL scripts. If you have any questions or want to collaborate please
feel free to reach out to me on

Deep dives

### Business problems using simulated data-sets

For me it is important to find balance between speed and accuracy for
every analysis. According to my experience in industry sometimes a
good-enough answer we can reach within an hour is more valuable than the
perfect solution we could reach with days or months of work. For this
reason below I am showcasing what I can do less or more time at my hand
using 2 made up business questions. I completed these projects while
timing myself.

Methods used: Exploration of data distribution, Aggregating

-   What can I do within 8 hours ?

add D updated analysis

-   What can I do within 1-1.5 half?

add O updated analysis

### Academic projects

During my PhD in Cognitive neuroscience I enjoyed applying different
analytical methods, followed high standards in the reproducibility and
transparency of my projects by producing fully reproducible manuscripts
on the results.
