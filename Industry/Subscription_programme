\#Question: What is the impact of joining the subscription programme on
a business that cares about customer ordering frequency and value?

\#\#Executive summary

-   The subscription plan significantly increases the frequency and
    value of orders in the whole sample when compared to the
    pre-subscription stage.
-   The highest increases appear during the active subscription stage,
    but there are carry-over increases in the measures after
    cancellation, suggesting behavioural changes in the customers.
-   The analysis revealed further differences between customers who
    retain their active subscription status and those who cancel around
    the end of the trial phase of the programme. Despite making up only
    24 % of the whole sample the Retention group represents very
    valuable customers as they place significantly more valuable orders
    more frequently than the Churn group.
-   The increases in the frequency and value of orders associated with
    the subscription programme translate into a clear growth of revenue.
    Within the Retention group we can see a linear increase in the
    frequency and value of orders with time, specifically when entering
    their fourth active subscription month.

\#\#Data analysis

One can re-frame the above question on a data analysis level in the
following way: Does the monthly subscription stage affect ordering
frequency and value?

All-analyses were conducted using *R* (Version 3.5.1). For the analysis
script and exact test statistics please refer to the corresponding R
MarkDown document.

When exploring the data set, we see that it consists of different
numbers of observation from N =1857 customers over 10 months of
uninterrupted time-period. The descriptive statistics of the data set
(see table below) reveal that on average, customers seem to increase
both during an active subscription phase and after cancelling the
programme. However, one needs to run test statistics to see if the
different subscription states are statistically different from one
another.

It is good practice to filter out outliers (here defined as values +/- 3
standard deviations away from the mean) before running statistical
analyses, but here the data set remains the same after filtering.

Nonetheless, when plotting the distribution and individual data points
with their central metrics (see figures below), it is clear that the
distribution skewed (frequently the case with real-world data) and the
frequency of 0 values are overrepresented in the sample. To address
this, further filtering and transformations (or fitting models with
non-normal distributions) could be done, but for this exercise I decided
to keep the untransformed values as they are.

Given that monthly subscription state has 3 levels, linear regression
was applied to see its effects on order frequency and value.

The analysis revealed a significant increase from pre-subscription stage
both in the active and cancelled states for the frequency and value of
the orders (see figure below). This result suggests that a subscription
has facilitating effect on ordering behaviour, even after cancelling the
programme. Both fitted models explained 6% of the variance for both
outcome measures.

While the results seem to suggest the efficiency of the subscription
programme the question arises whether this is true for all types of
customers. It is possible that customers who were only interested in the
two-week-long, free subscription period are different from the customers
who retained their subscription.

At this stage customers were split into two groups such as the Retention
group and Churn group based on the number of active monthly
subscriptions. To avoid the inclusion of accidental customers who might
have forgotten to cancel, only customers with more than 1 active month
were included in the Retention group. The rest of the customers made up
the Churn group.

The summary tables (see below) suggest that customers who had at least 1
active monthly subscription also kept their subscription for 1 other
month at least. Specifically, this can be seen in Churn group where
there was no-one in the Active stage throughout the 10 month period. We
can see that both the frequency and the value of the average order per
month increased during the active months for the Retention group.
Interestingly, even after cancelling the subscription (i.e. after an
active period or around the 2 week-long trial) the frequency and value
seem to remain higher than in the pre-subscription period - suggesting
behavioural change in the customer. Another, interesting observation is
that the Retention and Churn group differ in terms of their baseline
(i.e. pre-subscription). This data could be a useful starting point when
preparing a strategy for targeting certain customers (but it is not
under the scope of the present analysis).

To test the effects of the monthly subscription state within the two
groups separately, linear regressions were run on the data. The analysis
revealed the significant increasing effect of monthly subscription state
on both order value and frequency in both groups (to a higher extent in
the Retention group).

![](portfolio1_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-13-1.png)![](portfolio1_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-13-2.png)

To see if the two groups of customers were statistically different from
one to another two linear regressions were run after combining the two
groups into one, using a newly created categorical factor (i.e. group
membership: Retention, Churn). Based on the results there is indeed a
significant difference between these two kinds of customer at both
outcome measures (see figure below).

![](portfolio1_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-15-1.png)![](portfolio1_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-15-2.png)

When further investigating the two groups we can see that the majority
of customers belong to the Churn group (76% of all customers). Despite
being smaller, the Retention group represents very valuable customers as
they place more frequent and valuable orders than the Churn group (see
figure below).

![](portfolio1_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-18-1.png)![](portfolio1_files/figure-markdown_strict/unnamed-chunk-18-2.png)

We can look at the differences in terms of generated revenue between the
two groups (see table below). For the calculations below we used £2.5 as
the delivery fee payerd by the customer, £7.99 as the subscription fee
and 20% comission rate. Based on the tables below it is clear that the
subscription programme generates increased revenue during the active and
cancelled states, and the Retention group customers are outstandingly
valuable for the business (economically speaking).

As the Retention group proved to be valuable, it is worth gaining a
deeper understanding on the behaviour of this group. For instance, it
can be interesting to test whether having an active subscription changes
their ordering behaviour in the *long-term*. To see whether increasing
number of months have a growing facilitation effect as time passes I
created a variable coding for the accumulated number of active monthly
subscriptions. After this, linear regressions were run where the months
passed was coded both as a continuous and as a categorical predictor.
While the first one is good for quantifying general effect of time the
other analysis can help to identify break-points within the 10-month
period.

The analysis revealed a significant positive linear relationship between
the increasing number of active subscription months and increasing
number of order frequency and value. When the active subscription months
were coded as categories one can see the significant increases appear
from the fourth active month. While in the tenth month there seems to be
a significant drop it is likely to be arbitrary, probably because the
data collection was finished at beginning of the tenth (final) month
(see figures below).

\#\#Limitations and future steps

While the statistical tests provide confidence in the accuracy of these
results it must be noted that the some of the assumptions these tests
hold are violated by the distribution of the analysed sample. Accuracy
could be further improved by acquiring exact data on monthly costs and
revenue associated for every customer. Furthermore, collaboration with
the product management and user research team would help with the
interpretation and validation of the results regarding different types
of subscribers. Finally, data on the customers’ activity from the
business’s competitors would deepen the insights on the impact of the
subscription programme.
